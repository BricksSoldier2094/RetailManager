# Retail Manager System
Retail Manager System. This software was created through 'TimCo Retail Manager' a course available on YouTube given by Tim Corey (https://www.iamtimcorey.com/)


## Goals
  - Demonstrate modern development techiniques.
  - Model how an application grows over time.
  - Create a platform that needs to be upgraded to newer technologies.
  - Create a platform to demonstrate how incorporate new techiniques or tools into an existing software.
  - Create a hands-on learning tool for develipers to use to simulate a work environment.
  
  
## Situation Step
  - In this simulation, we work for TimCo Enterprise Solutions. We build solutions that we can then sell to clients. 
    Right now, we have been assigned to build a retail management system. Over time, we will get new requirements,
    or new work entirely, just like a real job.
    
  
## Initial Project
   - We have to build a desktop app that runs a cash register, handles inventory and manages the entire store.
    In order to allow it to grow, though, we will be creating a Web API layer.
    
  
## Initial Plan
   - We're build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that we can expand to cover all of the features we need over time. The first step is         getting   all of the major pieces set up, including:
      1. Git on AzureDevOps
      2. SQL DataBase (using SSDT - SQL Server Data Tools)
      3. Web API with authentication (MS Identity)
      4. WPF Application that can log in to the API
